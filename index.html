                    This was my senior design project and was worked on by three senior students including myself. 
                    Our project goals and components were given by our sponsor, LASSI (Laboratory for Advanced Space Systems at Illinois). 
                    The main goal of our project was to build a new power board for their next generation model of CubeSats, a small cube shaped satellite, along with implementing I2C and CANBus protocols. 
                    The power board was requested to have the battery and solar powered panels be more energy efficient.
                    I2C was requested in order to implement safety features for each components and additionally allow us to read and send each component’s telemetric status. 
                    Finally, CANBus protocols was used to communicate between our microcontroller and the control + data handling board. This communication would allow our sponsors to create and execute custom instructions for the power board. 
                    The approximate time we had in implementing our solution was roughly three months and we approximately followed an agile development cycle.
                    Due to our project producing admirable results within a short amount of time, we additionally received an honorable award for our project.
                    Overall, working on this project not only helped me learn the internal functionality of a power board and basic networking protocols, but also taught me about time management along with being able to read and write technical reports in an efficient manner.

                    MakerLab is a 3D printing lab which offers 3D printing services ranging from the general consumer to students. 
                    Print orders can be done via in person or by using the online form submission. Depending on the size of the print, printing time can range from a few hours to a few days. 
                    In addition, I worked on a microcontroller-website system that helped notify customers the status of each of the 3D printers along with their 3D printer part status. 
                    I focused mainly on trying to connect between the 3D printer's temperature setting to the microcontroller as we were going to use temperature as an indicator for when the 3D printer was active or not. 
                    The internship roughly lasted for 6 months throughout the school semester and the cycle was leaning towards more agile.
                    The main overall lessons that were useful to me was interacting with the customers and attempting to find a solution current issues in the facility. 
                    Helping those issues made me feel like I was able to help make a positive contribution towards the business along with improving the overall facility.

                      Kofman Technologies was a startup company that focused on making consumer friendly drones and drone controllers. 
                      During the time that I was working at the company, the company was focused on creating a user friendly drone controller. 
                      The main difference was that the design focused on a joystick controller rather than the traditional rectangular shaped box controller. 
                      In order to find our drone controller's competitive advantage, I wrote up a survey and conducted a day long session in which people would compare between our drone controller and the traditional rectangular shaped box controller.
                      Some of the questions focused on the aesthetic of the controller, gripability, comfortability, etc. 
                      Additionally, I helped solder several electronic components together for several drones along with maintaining 3D printed parts.
                      The time I spent working in this internship was roughly 7 months and we mostly followed an agile development cycle. 
                      I was able to learn more about the startup culture along with the different work cycle that I had to adapt to at the time. 
                      Overall, I was able to learn more about idea developments along with applying some of my background skills in a rapid developed product.

                    This analysis focused on determining which variables made a larger impact in determining whether a restaurant was successful or not. The general notion of a successful restaurant
                    can be summarized as good service, food, location, and reasonable pricing. Using the FourSquare API database, I gathered BBQ restaurants data scattered across the USA and created 
                    a dataset that consisted of the restaurant's name, location, rating, menu items, etc. Due to the many of the rows containing missing values, I evaluated that I cannot make a predictive
                    model using the current dataset I have as this may not accurately represent the datasets actual distribution. Thus, I focused on making a cluster model that would help identify any patterns 
                    in the current the dataset. DBSCAN clustering turned out to be the one that was able to give a reasonable cluster and the resulting cluster showed number of rating reviews and pricing to
                    stand out.

                      This was my user interface class semester project and was worked on by five university students including myself. 
                      Our group developed the project over the semester with key emphasis on user experience concepts and designs. 
                      Our idea was to create a website that would help recommend courses tailored to UIUC students based on their interests. Additional features on our website also included improving the course’s catalogue and helping grad students find professors that matched their research interests. 
                      The website itself was written in HTML/CSS/JS and was done using the bootstrap package. 
                      Additionally, the website was hosted using the cPanel. 
                      The development time was roughly three months and focused on an agile development cycle. 
                      Upon our website's completion, we were able to address each of our targetted user's problems and have them be satisfied with our implemented solution.
                      Working on this project helped me learn about connecting user interface concepts with website development along with the process of implementing user's feedbacks.

                      This was my digital signal processing lab final project and was worked on by three university students including myself. 
                      The project’s requirement was to implement a DSP algorithm from a written research paper, take that algorithm and create a meaningful product that users can use, and implement the algorithm on an android app. 
                      Our focused DSP algorithm was the eigenfaces and canny/sobel algorithm. 
                      The final intended implemented product utilizing these algorithms would be a security camera app. 
                      Our app would focus on being able to detect a person’s face and check if the person’s face was in the facial database. 
                      If the face was in the database, we would return the predicted name associated with the picture taken in real time. 
                      Additionally, our app would be able to take a picture of an object that a person was holding and determine whether the object was dangerous or not. 
                      The development cycle was roughly two months and was done on an iterative development cycle. 
                      Overall, the app managed to run relatively smooth and the identification portion took roughly from 2-4 seconds. 
                      This was to be expected as we have to apply histogram equalization and canny edge onto the captured frame image.
                      The general lessons learned from doing this project came from implementing a research paper algorithm and constantly improving upon our implementation until we managed to hit all our desired milestones.

                    Our project idea was to make a cup stacking robot in which the robot would stack cups based on the number that the user inputted.
                    We used the UR3 robot as our main robot and simulated the robot in V-REP. 
                    The project timespan was roughly three months and the development cycle was done on an iterative life cycle. 
                    In the end, we were able to successfully simulate the cup stacking procedure and incorporate sensor readings, forward kinematics, decision making, etc.
                    This project taught me the fundamental usage of V-REP along with the applications of different robotics concept that could be applied to any currently existing robots.

                      We used Django to host our website locally and used SQL to retrive information from the database hosted on MySQL.

                      This project was the final lab assignment that we had to do for our controls system class and was worked on by two university students including myself. 
                      The assignment’s main goal was to have the reaction wheel pendulum be able to stand upright without any physical interaction and to utilize concepts from controls systems to help maintain that position. 
                      We used MATLAB/Simulink to design and simulate our control systems. 
                      The assignment’s length was approximately one month and was done on a waterfall development cycle. 
                      Overall, the assignment allowed us to utilize our knowledge in controls, helped us design our own system, and apply them on a real mechanical component. 
                      The team cooperation for this project was also distributed evenly and thus, most of the deadlines and requirements were finished in a smooth manner.

                    This was my digital systems laboratory final project and was worked on by two people including myself. 
                    The requirements for the project focused on utilizing the FPGA board and SystemVerilog. 
                    The chosen project was a RPG game as several of the necessary setup needed was done in prior labworks. 
                    The project lasted for roughly two months and was done on a waterfall development cycle.   
                    In the end, we managed to create a functioning prototype game that was able to draw sprites, take in key inputs, and simulate a basic combat sequence.
                    The main lessons that were obtained from doing the project came from how hardware programming functions and taking in key hardware considerations when designing our game.

                      This was my engineering open house event project and was worked on by three university students including myself. 
                      This annual event showcased numerous student's engineering/science department projects.
                      As we were part of the IEEE circuits club, our project had to center around some form of circuitry. 
                      We ended up making an interactive LED cube in which the LED would either brighten or dim based on proximity. 
                      The project timespan was roughly two months and was done on a waterfall cycle.    
                      Though we only managed to solder two out of the six sides, we were able to demonstrate that our functionality worked properly and create a meaningful product that the general public enjoyed interacting with.
                      Overall, I learned how to apply some basic circuits concepts, formulate schedules and tasks as a team, and solder multiple components together.

                      This was my first engineering project that I was able to participate in and was comprised of roughly 20 high school students.
                      We participated in the Lemelson-MIT event in which approximately 14 schools would be given a grant and be chosen to showcase their ideas to the general public at MIT. 
                      Our idea was to make a smart watch and docking system that targeted in people who had first to second stage Alzheimers and patients who specifically would potentially wander out during the night. 
                      We approximately had 7-8 months to prepare for the showcase and we mostly worked on an agile development cycle. 
                      This was where my fundamental knowledge in developing solutions for problems that existed in the real world began.  
                      The people who mentored me during this time along with the people I worked with would give me an important lesson in networking and a deep honor in being able to work alongside with these people.
